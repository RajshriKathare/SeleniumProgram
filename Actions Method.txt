                                          #Actions#(IMP)

--- Action is a concreate class of selenium.
--- It is used to perform keyboard & mouse actions:(Actions class is having 21 methods)
  1> mouse Hovering action:

                      1> moveToElement(webelement): -- Used to mouse hovering on targeted element.
                      2> moveToElement(WebElement target, int x offset , int y offset):  --- To perform mousehovering action on element on the given pixel values.
                          If we give +ve value then it move to right side & if give -ve value then move towards left side from targeted element.
   
                      3> moveByElement(int x Offset , int y offset):-- it is not mouse hovering ,  it just used to move mouse on webpage on given pixel values.

  2> Drag & drop action:-- dragAndDrop(): --  to perform dragging the element from source & drop in the destination.

  3> Right click action: contextClick(WebElement ele)
     
     DoubleClick(): -- To perform double click on webpage.
  4> Double click action : doubleClick(WebElement ele):---To perform double click on targeted webelement.

  5>key Down action:
  6> key Up action: 

  7> Click(): --- To perform clicking operation on entire webpage.

  8> Click(WebElement target): -- To perform clicking operation on Targeted webelement on webpage.
  
  9> ContextClick()---  To perform rightclick operation on entire webpage.

  10> ContextClick(Webelement target):-- To perform right click operation on targeted webelement.

  11> clickAndHold(): -- To perform clicking and holding the on webpage.

  12> clickAndHold(Webelement targeted): --- To perform click and hold operation on targeted element on webpage.

  13> Release(): -- To perform release operation on webpage 

  14> Release(Webelement targeted): --- To perform release operation on targeted element on webpage.

  15> perform() :  -- To perform action on webpage/webelement.
                   -- All the actions will be executed only when perform() method is called.
                  -- ReturnType is void.
                  -- All actions stored in actions array.

  16> sendkeys(charSequence..ch):
  
  17> sendkeys(webelement targeted, charSequence)----- to perfrom entering data.clicking,delete,backspace.

                        ----Steps use actions class---

1> identify the targeted Webelement on webpage
2> create object of Actions class
3> pass webdriver refrence as an argument to actions constructor
4> call the appropriate action on element. 
5> call perform() method

                                            # Select #<class>
 -- select class is used to handle dropdown.
 -- There are two types of dropdown:
   1> single list dropdown:
   2> Multi list dropdown:
 -- it is concreate class of selenium
 -- With the help of select class we can select & deselect the element in dropdown.



  #steps to use select class:

1> Identify targeted element(i.e. dropdown) with method findelement().Where the targeted element should have <select> tag.

2> create the object of Select class.

3> And pass targeted element as argument in select constructor.

4>call appropriate non-static methods of select class to perform action.

         **methods of select class**

1> isMultiple() :  this method check targeted element(dropdown) is single list dropdown or multi list  dropdown.
                   --And its return type is boolean.
                   -- It returns true when targeted element is multi list dropdown.
                   -- It returns false when targeted element is single list dropdown.

2> getOptions() :
                  -- 	It gives all the options of targeted dropdown which is prsent inside <select> tag.
                  --Return type is list<webelement>.
                  -- this method returns multiple options.

3> SelectByVisibleText(): --- To select element in dropdown.
                          --- return type is void.
                          --- pass argument in the form of String.
                          --- We select the element on the bases of text.

4> SelectByValue(): 
                         --- To select element in dropdown.
                          --- return type is void.
                          --- pass argument in the form of String.
                          --- We select the element on the bases of Attribute value.

5> SelectByIndex() : 
                          ---To select element in dropdown.
                          --- return type is void.
                          --- pass argument in the form of String.
                          --- We select the element on the bases of index value.

                              ** index value starts from 0.

6> DeselectByIndex():
7> DeselectByVisibleText()

                           ****************************Synchronization**********************************

        Synchronization: It is a process of matching Application loading speed and automation script execution speed , it is called as Synchronization.

           -- Application Loading speed is depeneds on INTERNET .
           -- Automation script speed is always faster.
           -- Automation script speed & application speed both should be matched then we are going to get proper output.
           -- Automation script speed & application speed both speeds are not matching then we get "NoSuchElemenetException" .
           --
           

  Q> When NoSuchElemenetException occures??
  1> Automation script speed & application speed both speeds are not matching then we get "NoSuchElemenetException" .
  2>  When source code is incorrect

 

-- To slow down the speed of Automation script speed execution we are going to use delay(waits).

                   **ways of Waits to slow down the automation script speed**

   1> Implicit wait : 
                -- The implicit wait is applicable only for two methods i.e findElement() ane findElements().
                -- We are getting NoSuchElementException (for findElement() method) And emptyList<Webelement>Exception (for findElements() method) .
                -- For every cycle it is having 500 milliseconds polling period / wait frequency / time interval. 
                -- it is also called "intelligent wait" , beacuse it save time.

  **Cycle how implicit wait works: Implicit wait is 2seconds(When internet is slow)

 1st cycle: ----- findElement() / findElements() -------- element is not present --- time is not over --- 
  wait for 500milliseconds(0.5s)----(remaining time 1.5s)

 2nd cycle: ----- findElement() / findElements() -------- element is not present --- time is not over ---
  wait for 500milliseconds(0.5s)----(remaining time 1s)

 3rd cycle: ----- findElement() / findElements() -------- element is not present --- time is not over ---
  wait for 500milliseconds(0.5s)----(remaining time 0.5s)

 4th cycle: ----- findElement() / findElements() -------- element is not present --- time is not over ---
  wait for 500milliseconds(0.5s)----(remaining time 0s)

 5th cycle: ----- findElement() / findElements() -------- element is not present --- time is over ---
  NoSuchElementException / emptyList<Webelement>Exception



   2> Explicit wait(): 
                   -- it is also called "intelligent wait" , beacuse it save time.
                   -- For every cycle it is having 500 milliseconds polling period / wait frequency / time interval. 
                   -- We are getting TimeOutException .

   3> Fluent wait:  used when if we want to make changes in polling period / wait frequency / time interval.
   4> thread.sleep(): 

                -- It is also having name blind wait , because it wont leave the control to the next line untill given tim is completed.
                -- Here we apply wait in the form of milliseconds.
                -- It is applicable only for current line.



   5> Pageloadtimeout():
                   --- applicable only for get() and navigate().to() method
                   --- by default both method are having infinite time delay so it is not throwing any exception.
                   --- 







 *** difference bet implicite & explicite

i

1> applicable only for findelement()
2> not work on conditions
3> getting exception NoSuchElement
4> timining is in seconds,milliseconds,ps etc.


e

1> rather then find findelement()
2>work on conditions
3> getting exception timeout
4>timing in only in the form of seconds
